# Visual-Bookmark-Manager
This program is a one file, one click start, Visual Bookmark Manager that does not require you to setup a server.


Features
- you can add bookmarks.
- make category for your bookmarks and drag and drop the bookmarks to them.
- Add a background image
- customize the bookmark managers colors
- side ribbon for quick category selection
- search and sort category's

i plan to add the option for users to use a server so you can see your bookmarks on multiple devices, but for now it is a local only and you have to save before you close the Bookmark Manager. autosave and local cache will be added shortly... Probably.
